# Pac-Man in C language using SDL2
#### Description:
 
Simplified Pacman written in C using [SDL2].
This is a simplified implementation of the game. The maze path is implemented using a graph, where each vertex is a game tile with edges to adjacent tiles. The Breadth-first Search (BFS) algorithm was used to calculate the shortest path when a ghost is eaten by pacman and has to return to the center of the maze. The game has only one level and the ghosts' movement is random. I wrote this program for my Data Structures class.
